We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please check out our <a href="/events/2019-kansas-city/2019-kansas-city-prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a> and drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}].

<hr>
DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that
depends on sponsorships. We do not have large vendor booths or sell product
presentations. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator
pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website
and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are
encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and
engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the
opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space
session, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy
marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good
impression on the attendees.
<br><br>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at
DevOpsDays on their own terms.
<br><br>
<p>
Premium sponsors get a full table where they can interact with those interested
to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject
they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference,
so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good
impression on the attendees.

Sponsors are responsible for providing high-res logos for use on the website and
in promotional materials. The preferred file formats are EPS or AI.
